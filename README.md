# Rust Installation Guide

## Getting Started

### Installing Rust
If you did not set up Rust during the lecture, you'll need to install it first. Open a terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh


The starter code can be found in the GitHub repository, under assignment-2. If you have not cloned the repository to your machine, do so now:

git clone https://github.com/makt96/Cryptography.git

cd Cryptography/
git stash --include-untracked
git pull
git stash pop
